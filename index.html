Most recently, I served as a Software Engineer III at JPMorgan Chase & Co., where I contributed to the transformation of large-scale legacy systems into a distributed, microservices-driven architecture. In this role, I worked across the full development lifecycle and partnered closely with cross-functional teams to deliver performant, reliable solutions at enterprise scale.  My technical strengths include ASP.NET, .NET Core, C#, microservices, Kafka, Redis, RESTful API development, and SQL/MySQL database design. I am passionate about building clean, maintainable systems and continuously enhancing my skills to stay aligned with modern engineering practices."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="./manifest.json"/><meta property="twitter:image" content="./social-image.png"/><meta property="og:image" content="./social-image.png"/><title>Nick Joe Velasco</title><script defer="defer" src="./static/js/main.94f1e4ca.js"></script><link href="./static/css/main.d6891a1d.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
