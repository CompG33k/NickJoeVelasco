      content="I am Nick Joe Velasco, a Senior Software Engineer with a B.S. in Computer Science from California State University, Long Beach, and over a decade of hands-on experience in designing and building modern, scalable applications.  Most recently, I served as a Software Engineer III at JPMorgan Chase & Co., where I contributed to the transformation of large-scale legacy systems into a distributed, microservices-driven architecture. In this role, I worked across the full development lifecycle and partnered closely with cross-functional teams to deliver performant, reliable solutions at enterprise scale.  My technical strengths include ASP.NET, .NET Core, C#, microservices, Kafka, Redis, RESTful API development, and SQL/MySQL database design. I am passionate about building clean, maintainable systems and continuously enhancing my skills to stay aligned with modern engineering practices."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
